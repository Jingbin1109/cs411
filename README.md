This is our submission for our CS 411 semester long project demo. Our team has created a system that provides inventory & recipe management
and recipes recommendation to help make the process of cooking at home more enjoyable for our customers.

Our project is a program to help users with their own personal kitchen inventory management and recipe creation. Especially during the pandemic, 
people are confined to their homes without the ability to dine at restaurants. As a result, weâ€™ve seen a significant increase in frequency of people 
cooking at home. Keeping track of all of your ingredients and making sure that you have the freshest ingredients possible becomes vital during this time.
Our inventory system hopes to improve on this process and make lives easier for at home chefs. Also, the users can collect their favorite cooking 
recipes and share their recipes.

Features:
- Inventory management, caloric intake and nutritional benefit of each ingredient.
- Recommend recipes based on the ingredients that you currently have as well as recommend recipes that can be made with 1-2 additional ingredients 
  that you can go out and buy at the supermarket.
- Users can create their own recipes and update this information into their online recipe book.
- Users can like other recipes.
- Users can follow other users and subscribe to others recipes.
- Friends/following function.

Software Used:
- MySQL on Google Cloud Platform for hosting our database.
- Django Framework
